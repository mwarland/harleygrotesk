Harley Grotesk: Typeface created by <a href="http://warland.ca">Matthew Warland</a>

This is my first 'starter sans' a typeface I designed and built while learning how to do so. I'm self taught, but have heavily leaned on tutorials by Grilli Type and books by authors like Rachel Cheng. It's a basic stab at a modern Neo-grotesk, and a full family variable font.

Harley was a dog, a fine co-pilot in life and an excellent creative director.
